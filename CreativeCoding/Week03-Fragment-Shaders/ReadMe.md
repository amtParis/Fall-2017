# Week 3: OOP Review, GLSL Shaders

## Topics:

- Creating classes and objects in OF
- Using vector<>
- Intro to fragment shaders

## Code Assignments

1. OOP: Create a custom class with its own unique drawing and update function. Use vectors or arrays to create many instances of them. Experiment with behaviors and movement.

2. Shaders: Use fragment shaders to create a composition that changes based on time or mouse position. Try to incorporate some easing functions into the experiment. 

3. Create at least 1 sketch, program, or experiment related to your individual research topic.
