# Week 5: Unity Begins

## Topics:

- Intro to C# scripts in Unity

## Code Assignments

1. Using either the fractal or swarm (or both!) examples, create a [*fill-in-the-blank*] generative design in Unity. Add materials, color, particle systems, sound etc.

2. Actions, reactions, collisions. Play with physics, triggers, collisions. Can you make something explode into a particle system on collision? I bet you can!
