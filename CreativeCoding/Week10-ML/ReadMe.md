# Week 10: ML Intro

## Topics:

- Machine Learning

##  Assignments

1. Find a new image set to visualize using TSNE (you may use the download scripts from class or the examples or find a set in another way). Create a TSNE image grid using ofxTSNE and save your results. If you want to experiment with other types of data, you may, and be sure to take screenshots of the results.

2. Train the char-rnn on a new text (it should not be too short or training will not produce good results) and run it through ofxMSATensorFlow example to generate new texts. Save the most interesting results.

3. Try out [DeepArt](https://deepart.io) to create a series of original style transfer images.

4. Make some significant progress on the final projects!!!
