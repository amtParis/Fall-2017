1. Vertex Shaders: Look at the audio input examples and see if you can use volume as a uniform passed to a vertex shaders that modifies a 3d primitive in some unique and/or unusual way. *Did I hear some say gif?*

2. OF Complete: Create a complete OF app that is: interactive, has a gui to change some parameters, can toggle fullscreen, has at least 3 “Scenes” or game mode with different effects or interactions. Consider using core addons we have not tried yet. *(due in 2 weeks)*

3. Add another sketch, program, or experiment related to your individual research topic and update your document on what you have discovered on the topic.
