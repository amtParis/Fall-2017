## Code Assignments:

1. Create an animation that uses oscillations, angles, rotations and/or tweens. It may be 2d or 3d. Add a gui to adjust certain parameters. Post a gif

2. Convert one of your Week 1 assignments to Openframeworks.

3. Review the OOP reading and create a sketch that makes a custom class that is a "creature" that can follow the mouse and rotates correctly in the direction it moves. Give your creatures some personality. See if you can make multiples that follow at different speeds.
