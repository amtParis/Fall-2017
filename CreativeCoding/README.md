# Creative Coding

During this course students will advance their programming skills while also exploring creative expression through code. The focus will be on graphics programming, algorithmic motion,  interactivity, and machine learning. We will use a variety of programming languages (C++, C#, Javascript, GLSL, Python) and platforms (Openframeworks, P5.js, Unity). Topics may include: trigonometry and easing functions, 3d mesh manipulation, interactivity in VR and AR spaces, GLSL Shaders, Machine Learning.
