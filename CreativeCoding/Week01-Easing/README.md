# Week 1 : Easing and Interpolation

## Topics:
- Numbers between 0 and 1 are awesome
- Linear / Non-linear Interpolation
- Zeno for smoothing a value

## Code Assignments:

*Use either P5.js or OpenFrameworks for this week's assignments. Post your work on github or bitbucket.*

1. Complete the easing "cheat sheet" exercise from class to show various types of curves (*extra credit* : animate along curves only on mouse over). 

2. Create composition using tweens and/or zeno to apply different changes in properties - motion, shape, scale, volume. Try to make it smooth, elegant and organic. Make a gif of your results.

3. Modify your composition or create a new one that augments or overlays an existing image (render on top of a photograph, drawing, design etc.)


## Reading Assignments:

[Chapter 01: How OF Works](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/how_of_works.html) from the ofBook

[Chapter 03: setup and project structure](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/setup_and_project_structure.html) from the ofBook

[Chapter 04: Animation](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/animation.html) from the ofBook (up to Function based movement)

Optional Sci-Fi Reading: [The Murder](http://www.sediment.uni-goettingen.de/staff/dunkl/zips/The-Murderer.pdf), by Ray Bradbury

## Preparation for Next Class:

List 3 areas you may want to research for your semester project.

Download [Openframeworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) and install the appropriate IDE for your platform (Xcode for Mac, Visual Studio for Windows)
