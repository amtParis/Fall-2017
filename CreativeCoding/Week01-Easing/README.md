# Week 1 : Easing and Interpolation

## Topics:
- Numbers between 0 and 1 are awesome
- Linear / Nonlinear Interpolation
- Zeno for smoothing a value

## Code Assignments:

1. Complete the easing "cheat sheet" exercise from class to show various types of curves (extra credit : animate along curves only on mouse over). 

2. Create a composition using tweens to apply different changes in properties - motion, shape, scale, volume. Make a gif of your results. 

3. 

You may use P5.js or OpenFrameworks.

## Reading Assignments:

[Chapter 01: How OF Works](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/blob/master/chapters/how_of_works/chapter.md) from the ofBook

[Chapter 03: setup and project structure](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/blob/master/chapters/setup_and_project_structure/chapter.md) from the ofBook

[Chapter 04: Animation](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/blob/master/chapters/animation/chapter.md) from the ofBook (up to Function based movement)

## Preparation for Next Class:

Download [Openframeworks](http://openframeworks.cc) and install the appropriate IDE for your platform (Xcode for Mac etc.)
